Absolute vs Relative Paths
	Amanda could use the following commands
	cd ~
	cd ~/data/..
	cd
	cd ..
Relative Path Resolution
	ls ../backup will display: original pnas_finals pnas_sub
ls Reading Comprehension
	to display pnas_sub/ pnas_final/ original/ use the commands:
	ls -r -F
	ls -r -F /Users/backup
Exploring More ls Arguments
	using the arguments -l and -h with the ls command results in the display of the long 		listing format (-l), and the display of the file size in "human readable" form (-h)
Listing Recursively and by Time
	the directories will be listed alphabetically, and the files/directories in each directory 		will be sorted by time
